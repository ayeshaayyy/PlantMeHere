# PlantMeHere

This is a mobile application coded in P5 Javascript language. This app is just for educational purpose.

The Plant me here app solves Landscape Architect issues. It can exactly measure the land and analyze the weather on multiple factors like humidity, sun rays, and precipitation to give you exact recommendations as to which location is best suitable for a garden to grow and what plants you can grow at that location.

Here's a link for a complete documentation about all user research and user interface.
